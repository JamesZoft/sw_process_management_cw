\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this report is to produce a full and complete set of requirements and goals for a workout recorder app, along with a detailed scope and diagrams to support all of this. I will first analyse what the client's reqirements are and how these translate into high level requirements, then break these down into functional and non-functional requirements. I will then use these requirements to produce a set of goals for the system and the needed diagrams (e.g. UML, sequence, collaboration, etc) that will further explore the system. The goal of this report will be such that, when it is finished, a developer or team of developers will be able to take it and build the system it describes.

\section{Requirements}

\subsection{High-level Requirements}

The high level requirements of this project are as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item Record which workouts are done or gym classes are followed that day
\item Record progress made and goals achieved per workout
\item Be able to visualise achivements/goals via graphs or other statistical methods
\item App is able to upload progress, achievments and goals to a user-made account
\item App is able to work without being connected to the internet
\item Non-technical and intuitive user interface
\item Development time of three to six months
\item Budget of \pounds20,000-\pounds30,000

\end{itemize}
